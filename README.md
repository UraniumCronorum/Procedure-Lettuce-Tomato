##Overview
LambdaVania is a 2D sidescroller game, in the vein of the Metroidvania/Igavania style of games. The music for the game, and to some extent the level design, is procedurally generated (level layout is currently one-dimensional).

##Concepts Demonstrated

* **Higher order procedures** such as map and foldl/foldr to convert lists of notes into rsounds, and consolidate multiple rsounds into a single rsound.
	* Map and foldl/foldr are also used to implement level graphics via a tiling system.
* **Abstraction** of sounds as musical notes.
	* There is an **abstraction barrier** between the graphics library and the actual game code, so that the means by which the graphics are loaded/produced doesn't necessarily break the game code.

<!--
Identify the OPL concepts demonstrated in your project. Be brief. A simple list and example is sufficient. 
* **Data abstraction** is used to provide access to the elements of the RSS feed.
* The objects in the OpenGL world are represented with **recursive data structures.**
* **Symbolic language processing techniques** are used in the parser.
-->

##External Technology and Libraries

Libraries used:
* rsound (https://docs.racket-lang.org/rsound/index.html)
	* Used for actually representing and playing the sounds generated by the music generator.
* 2htdp (https://docs.racket-lang.org/teachpack/2htdpimage.html and https://docs.racket-lang.org/teachpack/2htdpuniverse.html)
	* Used to implement animation and interaction, i.e. the video game itself.
* racket/gui (https://docs.racket-lang.org/gui/)
	* Used in a variety of different ways as part of the process by which the sprites and level tiles were created.
	* In particular, the draw library (https://docs.racket-lang.org/draw/index.html) allows, well, drawing.

External technology:
* GIMP (https://www.gimp.org/) to make minor edits to certain completed graphics.

##Favorite Scheme Expressions

####Wesley
The following function is used to create the level background by tiling a single image. What's cool about this to me is that it uses the accumulate syntax to create the graphics in a similar way to the fashion that we normally use it to construct lists. It's an interesting demonstration of exactly the kind of power that Racket's higher order procedures actually have.
```
(define (tile image x y)
  ;; Generate the rows
  (let ([row (foldl (lambda (i out) (overlay/xy out i 0 image))
                    empty-image
                    (map (lambda (i) (* i (image-width image))) (range x)))])
    ;; Generate the entire image based on the rows
    (foldl (lambda (i out) (overlay/xy out 0 i row))
           empty-image
           (map (lambda (i) (* i (image-height image)))
                (range y)))))
```

####David

While generating the psuedo-random audio sequences, the program uses symbolic music theory objects rather than rsounds during the computation process.  This is both for performance and programming efficiency.  The base unit is a music note. Notes are organized into measures, which are organized into staff parts, which are organized on an ensemble staff.  The resulting ensemble staff is an object containing lists of lists of lists of note objects.

My favorite section of code in this project is this series of abstractions of map and foldl expressions, which builds lists of lists of note objects into a single playable rsound.  

```
;; Convert an ensemble-staff object into an rsound
(define (e-staff->rsound staff)
  (rs-overlay* (map staff-part->rsound (e-staff->partlist staff))))
  
;; Convert a staff-part into an rsound
(define (staff-part->rsound staff-part)
 (if (staff-part? staff-part)
     (measure->rsound
      (append-measure*
       (staff-part->measurelist staff-part))
      (instrument->proc (staff-part->instrument staff-part)))
     (raise-type-error 'staff-part->instrument "StaffPart" staff-part)))
     
;; Take a measure and a procedure that converts notes to rsounds
;; and apply the procedure to all notes in the measure
(define (measure->rsound measure note-to-rsound-proc)
  (cond ((and (measure? measure) (procedure? note-to-rsound-proc))
           (rs-append* (map (lambda (x) (if (harmony? x)
                                           (harmony->rsound x  note-to-rsound-proc)
                                           (note->rsound x note-to-rsound-proc)))
                            (measure->notelist measure))))
         (else
          (if (procedure? note-to-rsound-proc)
             (raise-type-error 'arg1 "Measure" measure)
             (raise-type-error 'arg2 "procedure" note-to-rsound-proc)))))

;; Take a note object and a procedure which can turn
;; the note into an rsound.  Call the procedure with
;; the note object as an argument
(define (note->rsound note note-to-rsound-proc)
  (cond ((and (note? note) (procedure? note-to-rsound-proc))
           (rs-filter (note-to-rsound-proc note) reverb))
         (else
          (if (procedure? note-to-rsound-proc)
             (raise-type-error 'arg1 "Note" note)
             ((raise-type-error 'arg2 "procedure" note-to-rsound-proc))))))


```
All of the previous append-{item} and append-{item}* functions are implemented by combining append with foldl in the same manner as the following example:
```
;; Concatenate two measure objects
(define (append-measure m1 m2)
  (cond ((and (measure? m1) (measure? m2))
         (make-measure (append (measure->notelist m1)
                              (measure->notelist m2))))
         (else
           (if (measure? m1)
             (raise-type-error 'arg1 "Measure" m1)
             (raise-type-error 'arg2 "Measure" m1)))))

;; Concatenate a list of measure objects
(define (append-measure* measurelist)
  (foldl (lambda (x y)
           (if (eq? y '())
               x
                (append-measure x y))) '() measurelist))
```

###Mark (a team member)
Each team member should identify a favorite expression or procedure, written by them, and explain what it does. Why is it your favorite? What OPL philosophy does it embody?
Remember code looks something like this:
```scheme
(map (lambda (x) (foldr compose functions)) data)
```
####Lillian (another team member)
This expression reads in a regular expression and elegantly matches it against a pre-existing hashmap....
```scheme
(let* ((expr (convert-to-regexp (read-line my-in-port)))
             (matches (flatten
                       (hash-map *words*
                                 (lambda (key value)
                                   (if (regexp-match expr key) key '()))))))
  matches)
```

##Additional Remarks
<!-- Anything else you want to say in your report. Can rename or remove this section. -->
Both the 2htdp/image and rsound libraries seem to run very slowly in some circumstances. As a result, this game takes a long time (couple minutes) to load.

#How to Download and Run

### Statement
* Describe your project. 
	* A Procedurally generated 2D Sidescroller/ Platformer Game
* Why is it interesting? 
	* Many elements of the game including both graphics and audio will be psuedo-randomly procedurally generated.
* Why is it interesting to you personally? 
	* (Wesley) I've tried my hand at game design in the past, but have yet to make a full game. This is an opportunity for me to create a complete game while also learning & experimenting with a new design technique.
	* (David) I have a background in music/audio composition, and I am also an hobbyist gamer.  I've been interested in procedural generation of music for a while.  This project will allow me to explore all of these areas.  
* What do you hope to learn? 
	* Real-world applications of functional programming concepts.
	* How some of Racket's sound, graphics, and gaming libraries work.
	* How procedural generation works in videogames.

### Analysis

Procedural generation requires recursion/iteration as content is generally created one piece at a time, with the content of future pieces partially dependent on that of previous pieces.
An object-oriented approach will be useful for representing information about individual characters and physical objects in the scene, among other things.

During the audio generation process, audio will be represented as lists of notes.  Map and Reduce will be used to convert lists of notes into rsounds, and consolidate multiple rsounds into a single rsound.

Digital Audio is both resource-heavy and unintuitive to think about musically.  As such, it will be abstracted as music notes and sound effects.

### Data set or other source materials

The visuals will require external files containing the relevent images. These can be created in GIMP/ Inkscape or using one of Racket's image libraries.
The audio may require audio samples of some sort.

### Deliverable and Demonstration
* We will have a playable 2D game to demonstrate at the end of the project.  
* If given a specific seed, it should always generate the same level layout and audio for that seed.

### Evaluation of Results
* We will be able to measure our success by ensuring:
	* User input causes the sprite to move correctly
	* All areas of procedurally generated levels are accessable by the sprite
	* Procedurally generated audio is smooth and plays at the correct times.
