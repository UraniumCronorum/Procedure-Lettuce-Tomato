## Overview
This is a continuation of this project: https://github.com/oplS16projects/Procedure-Lettuce-Tomato.
The goal is ultimately to develop the project into a full, playable, and sellable game.

The current plan is to iron out enough details for the game to be in what we consider its alpha stage, at which point a duplicate repository will be created and made private in order to finish the project.

## What is needed for alpha stage
This list may be updated in the future.

* 2-dimensional map generation
* Basic combat
* Different "flavors" of rooms
* NPCs and working dialogue
* improvements to the graphics system making it easier to organize, use, and add animations

Actual content (graphics, story, etc.) will be devoloped only as necessary to test the functionality of the above.
